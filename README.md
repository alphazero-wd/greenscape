## Overview

### About the project 📚

Greenify is an e-commerce application that is built to sell plants, but it can also be converted to selling other things.

### Project Structure

The application consists of three main components:

- [`/admin`](https://github.com/alphazero-wd/greenify/tree/master/admin): the admin is built to manage products, inventory, and customers' orders, as well as summarizing some stats such as revenues, sales, etc.
- [`/store`](https://github.com/alphazero-wd/greenify/tree/master/store): the store is built to display products to customers for them to buy
- [`/server`](https://github.com/alphazero-wd/greenify/tree/master/server): the backend API

### Tech stack ☕️ 🐍 ⚛️

#### Frontend

- Next.js: React-based but with SSR, which leads to better SEO
- TailwindCSS: takes the utility-first approach for better adjustability according to the design, used with `shadcn/ui` which provides some pre-built UI components

#### Backend

- NestJS: ExpressJS-based framework, but provides the project with a better architecture, which helps the project scale later
- Prisma: makes working with the database a lot easier, especially when managing migrations

#### Databases

- PostgreSQL: there are plenty of relationships between entities, so a relational database fits the project well
- Redis: storing users' session data

### Challenges

- Managing uploaded files is difficult **without** any cloud storage like Amazon S3, Cloudinary.
- First time handling Stripe payments is rather tough because the documentation does not specify exactly how to integrate Stripe with Next.js and NestJS.
- Having to resolve conflicts between pagination, filtering and sorting when working with URL query manipulation.
- Forgetting to add role-based guards to some restricted endpoints resulting in security leaks.

### Features to be added

- Authentication on the store so that the customers' data will be synchronized across devices.
- Product variants so that the customers can choose which variant matches their preferences.
- PayPal will be added as an alternative payment method to cards.

## Getting started 💻

You need to have these tools installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli#install)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

To get started, clone the project from GitHub

```
git clone https://github.com/alphazero-wd/greenify.git
```

### Setup the server

Install all dependencies

```bash
cd server/
yarn
```

Set up Stripe Webhook with the following commands

```bash
stripe login
stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:5000/webhook
```

In the `server/` directory, create a `docker.env` file at the root and add the following:

```bash
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres # set to anything you like
POSTGRES_DB=greenify # set to anything to you like
```

Similarly, create a `.env` at the root of the `server/` directory and add the following variables:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/greenify?schema=public
SESSION_SECRET=s3cret # set to anything you like
CORS_ORIGIN_ADMIN=http://localhost:3000
CORS_ORIGIN_STORE=http://localhost:3001
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_... # from the Stripe dashboard
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_... # from the Stripe CLI
SERVER_URL=http://localhost:5000 # current server URL
```

Run PostgreSQL and Redis databases stipulated in the `docker.compose.yml` file

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Apply migrations to the database

```bash
yarn migrate
```

Finally, start the server:

```bash
yarn start:dev
```

### Setup the admin

Install all dependencies

```bash
cd admin/
yarn
```

Create a `.env.local` file at the root of the `admin/` directory and add the following variable:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000 # server URL
```

Simply start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```
yarn dev
```

### Setup the store

Install all dependencies

```bash
cd store/
yarn
```

Create a `.env.local` file at the root of the `store/` directory and add the following variable:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000 # server URL
```

Simply start the development server on http://localhost:3001

```
yarn dev
```

## Approaches 🚶

- For the backend, NestJS already adopts Dependency Injection out of the box, which loosens the dependence between different parts of the codebase.
- For the frontend, I adopts [Facade Design Pattern](https://wanago.io/2019/12/09/javascript-design-patterns-facade-react-hooks/) by extracting hooks into dedicated files to separate the logic from the UI.
